.SH NAME
jython.conf \- Jython registry for system-wide options
.SH DESCRIPTION
When running
.BR jython (1)
or
.BR jythonc (1),
a number of properties may be set to customise Jython's behaviour.
Properties can be assigned values in any of the following four ways.
This list is arranged from lowest to highest priority; thus for
instance a property set in a user's personal registry will override the
same property set in the system-wide registry.
.TP
.I Java system properties
Jython options may be set in the standard Java system properties.
However, since the jython and jythonc startup scripts take responsibility
for starting the Java interpreter, it is unlikely that you will use this
method of Jython configuration.
.TP
.I Jython system-wide registry
The system-wide registry is the file \fI/etc/jython/jython.conf\fP.  It
contains a number of lines of the form \fIproperty\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP.
Lines that are empty or that begin with a hash (#) are ignored.
.TP
.I User's personal registry
The user's personal registry is the file \fI~/.jython\fP.  Its format is
the same as for the system-wide registry.
.TP
.I Command-line options
Properties may be specified when running jython or jythonc at the
command-line.  They are set using command-line options of the form
\fB\-D\fP\fIproperty\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP.
.SH PROPERTIES
The following properties may be set in the Jython registry.  Other less
used properties are also available; see the comments in the default
system-wide registry for further details.
.PP
If a property is
marked \fI(auto)\fP, the jython and jythonc startup scripts will attempt
to set this property automatically, although it can still be overridden in
the system or user registry or on the command-line.
.TP
.BR python.cachedir " (auto)"
The directory to use for caches (currently just package information).
This directory must be writable by the user.  If the directory is an
absolute path then it is used as given; otherwise it is interpreted as
relative to the root Jython directory (/usr/share/jython/).
.TP
.BR python.console
The name of the console class to use when running Jython from the command
prompt.  An alternative console class that emulates GNU readline can be
specified using this property.
.TP
.BR python.jythonc.classpath " (auto)"
Extensions to the Java property \fIjava.class.path\fP for use with jythonc.
This is used to put extra classes on your Java compiler's classpath (and
the core Java classes as well if your Java compiler requires them).
.TP
.BR python.jythonc.compiler " (auto)"
The Java compiler to use with jythonc when turning generated Java code
into Java class files.
This should be the absolute path to a Java compiler, or the
name of a compiler on your standard PATH.
.TP
.BR python.jythonc.compileropts
Options to pass to the Java compiler when using jythonc.
.TP
.BR python.path " (auto)"
The path on which Jython will look for additional python modules when
importing.  This variable has a similar function to CPython's PYTHONPATH
environment variable.
.TP
.B python.security.respectJavaAccessibility
Normally, Jython can only provide access to public members of classes.
However if this property is set to \fIfalse\fP and you are using Java 1.2 then
Jython can access non-public fields, methods and constructors.
.TP
.B python.verbose
Sets the verbosity level for informative messages.  All messages with at
least the specified severity will be displayed.
Valid values in order of increasing verbosity are \fIerror\fP, \fIwarning\fP,
\fImessage\fP, \fIcomment\fP and \fIdebug\fP.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR jython (1),
.BR jythonc (1).
.PP
If the Debian package \fIjython-doc\fP is installed,
full documentation from the Jython authors will be available in
\fI/usr/share/doc/jython-doc/html/\fP.
